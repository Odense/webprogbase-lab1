In 1979, his family moved to the newly built neighborhood in Kiev â€“ Obolon (Minsk District was created in 1975).
In Kiev, Kostrov went to the 216th City School and in 1986 (aged 9) enrolled into the football section coached by Oleksandr Shpakov. 
Because of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, together with his sport group he was evacuated temporarily from the city.
